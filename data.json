		"output": "<Assistant>Python is a programming language that has been available since the early 1990s, and continues to be widely used as an easy-to-understand and practical language. Python places great importance on the \"readability and understandability\" of programs, and is designed to be easy to understand even for people who are not familiar with Python.\nOf course, it is not just easy to read, but is also practical and highly extensible. The balance between readability, ease of learning, and practicality is one of the great attractions of Python.\nPython has always ranked highly in surveys of the usage of general-purpose programming languages. It has been widely used in system management, tool and application development, scientific and technical calculations, and web systems. In particular, during the machine learning boom that began around the 2010s, it was evaluated as an excellent scientific and technical calculation tool and gained great popularity.\nFrom 2020, Python has been added to the programming languages ​​that are asked in the Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination, a national qualification in Japan. In addition to languages ​​such as C and Java that were previously available, it is clear that Python is also used as a basic technology that supports the software industry.</Assistant>"

		"output": "<Assistant>LLM (Large Language Models) are text-based AI that have brought significant advancements in machine learning.\nMany LLMs are specialized in generating the continuation of text as generative AI, but with some ingenuity, they can also be used as chat-style interfaces.  \nThe most common mechanism behind LLMs is based on probabilistic models.  \nLLMs break down text into small parts using a mechanism called a \"tokenizer\" and learn the frequency and patterns of each word or phrase.\nThese patterns and frequencies are expressed probabilistically, with words having a higher probability being more likely to be generated. However, words with lower probabilities may still be generated under certain conditions. \nLow-probability words can sometimes lead to unnatural contexts or errors, which is one of the weaknesses of LLMs.  \nHowever, as the size of LLMs increases, the probability of generating correct words in accordance with the usual context also increases, making it easier to generate fewer errors in text. \nTherefore, by choosing the largest model possible, it is possible to generate highly accurate text even in local environments.\nNext, let's explain LLM models.  \nAn LLM model refers to the compilation of large LLM data into an executable format. A commonly used tool is the Python library \"Transformers.\" By using this library, you can combine datasets and tokenizers to build generative AI.\nIn summary:\n- LLMs are the foundation for building models that handle language, including generative AI, and the term can also refer to the model itself.\n- Generative AI predicts the next word probabilistically using LLMs to generate text.\n- By using the Transformers library in Python, you can easily create generative AI.</Assistant>"
