		"output": "<Assistant>Python is a programming language that has been available since the early 1990s, and continues to be widely used as an easy-to-understand and practical language. Python places great importance on the \"readability and understandability\" of programs, and is designed to be easy to understand even for people who are not familiar with Python.\nOf course, it is not just easy to read, but is also practical and highly extensible. The balance between readability, ease of learning, and practicality is one of the great attractions of Python.\nPython has always ranked highly in surveys of the usage of general-purpose programming languages. It has been widely used in system management, tool and application development, scientific and technical calculations, and web systems. In particular, during the machine learning boom that began around the 2010s, it was evaluated as an excellent scientific and technical calculation tool and gained great popularity.\nFrom 2020, Python has been added to the programming languages ​​that are asked in the Fundamental Information Technology Engineer Examination, a national qualification in Japan. In addition to languages ​​such as C and Java that were previously available, it is clear that Python is also used as a basic technology that supports the software industry.</Assistant>"
