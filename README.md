# Azuki.ai
This project is a fully public text generation AI project.

## About InDev2
Starting in April 2024, I will transition Azuki.ai to a new phase, "InDev2."
In InDev2, we will add missing features and make the dataset as large as possible.
After that, we will transition to the "Beta" and "Release" phases.

## Structure
Here's how this project currently works:
1. Prepare a dataset.
2. Train using a tokenizer such as GPT2.

## Contribution
We need your contributions.
Our published datasets are obviously sparse compared to other LLMs.
If anyone can help by adding data, even if only a little at a time, that would be very helpful.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Chat function
- [ ] Change to a larger setting than GPT2
